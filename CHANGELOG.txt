Known Issue:
- Including shared images in EditDoc documents only works as shared folder is a primary user folder (eg /files/[USER]/[SHARED FOLDER])

Changelog:
- Works with Owncloud 7 
- EditDoc language files (for now.. Dutch, English and German. Please send new language files to me. I will include them in the package)
- Insert and Select Images from ownCloud user repository
- TinyMCE 4.1.4
- Code optimalisation
- Adding EditDoc Quick Start feature. Browse to 'http://[YOURSERVER]/apps/editdoc/'
